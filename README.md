# Classic-Models-Vehicle-Sales-and-Profit-Analysis-Dashboard-using-PowerBi-SQL-DAX-Queries
The Classic Models project involves creating a comprehensive sales dashboard using Power BI. The main objective is to visualize the company's sales data to help stakeholders understand performance trends and make informed business decisions. The report includes various metrics and visualizations that highlight sales, profit, order counts, and average order values segmented by different categories. Additionally, button actions are utilized to navigate to a secondary dashboard, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. The project also involves using DAX queries for advanced calculations and SQL queries for data retrieval and transformation.
